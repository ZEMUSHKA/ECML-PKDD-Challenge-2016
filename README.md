# ECML-PKDD-Challenge-2016
This repository contains "Ya" team paper and solution for [ECML/PKDD 2016 Discovery Challenge](https://dms.sztaki.hu/ecml-pkkd-2016).

1. **paper** folder contains all the files for TeX paper compilation and resulting pdf.
2. **otp_task_1.ipynb** notebook contains all the necessary code to reproduce the submission on the public leaderboard.
3. **otp_task_2.ipynb** notebook contains all the necessary code to reproduce the solution pipeline with xgboost. 
The final submission uses Yandexâ€™s proprietary algorithm MatrixNet rather than xgboost and has a higher score on both cross-validation and public leaderboard.
4. **utils.py** contains some shared code for both tasks.
